  - Song Of The Week
---


I officially started my new job and while working I been listening to a lot more podcast and listening to a lot more music. One of the website I've used more often is https://jetsetradiofuture.live/ (https://github.com/RudiesGarage/jetsetradiofuture.live ). It's a fan made website that plays music from the Jet Set Radio series, fan-made music inspired by Jet Set Radio & songs made by Hideki Naganuma (the guy behind the Jet Set Radio OST). So I wanted my Song Of The Week to be themed after Hideki Naganuma. So I decided to up it from 2 to 4 just for this week (or until I change the rules again).
