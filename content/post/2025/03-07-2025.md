Sorry for the late post, work kinda killed me. But....

This is Soia. She was an artist I first listen to when I was a child. I've since forgotten about her and she would have stayed forgotten if it wasn't thanks to a little game called Bomb Rush Cyberfunk. This game feature one song, that being the same song I listened to all these years ago. The track is placed at #1 and I decided to choose a few songs to accompany it.
