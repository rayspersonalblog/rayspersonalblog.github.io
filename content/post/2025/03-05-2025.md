Here's a fun fact. I listened to this artist as a kid and just now found her again. Long story short while listening to Bomb Rush Cyber Funk OST You Can Say Hi by Soia appeared and I immediately recognized it from the first few second.  I'm not sure exactly how I found this artist originally but I listened to her music back when I was a kid so yeah here some song from her catalog.

Note: I will link to her catalog
