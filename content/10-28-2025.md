## New Setup AGAIN???


Hello everybody I've came with some interesting news. I've decided to switch from Arch Linux to Fedora Workstation. This is a decision that I actually been considering for a month or two into my full Linux deep dive. I decided to switch now because I started having problems with my PC which lead to the corruption of my original boot drive. I don't think it was Linux itself that destroyed the drive but I think the drive just ran it course (I had the thing since like 2017). So after getting a poor Amazon driver to deliver my package at 3 AM in the morning I finally got a new set of ram and new boot drive which is working spectacularly. 

Now I originally consider switching to Fedora because I wanted to make blog post about switching to Linux and how easy It could be but I thought it would be weird for me to be running a different distro compare to what I want everyone else to use. But another reason I didn't switch immediately was because I also thought It would have been easier to run a different distro like Linux Mint or Zion OS. I settled with Fedora because I think that Gnome after some tweaks and customization work perfectly and most of the software that people would need is located in the Flatpak store or require very little skills in order to get up and running. So starting this or next week I'll publish my starting Daily Driving Linux series start with how to install Linux and get started using Fedora.

I don't really have anything else to say other than I have another blog post I plan on posting about my new NAS but that will come out some other day and I'm planning on trimming it down significantly because it is way too long.
