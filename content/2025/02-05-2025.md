### Momodora Moonlit Farewell Is Coming Physically

When I saw the news three days ago that Momodora Moonlit Farwell was coming to consoles I was hyped not that Momodora was coming to console. But for the fact that Limited Run Games picked it up immediately instead of waiting two or three years then releasing the physical copy. Needless to say I purchased the standard edition which comes with the game and the reversable cover art. But I do plan on getting both the PS5 & Nintendo Switch versions of the Collectors Edition. As seen in  the picture below the collector's edition comes with the game, the official soundtrack, sticker sheet, an pin, a double-sided poster & the most important item, a Momo Figure. The figure alone was worth it to me but I will say as much as Momo is the main character of the Momodora series I feel like they should have at least made a Dora figure for the PS5 version or something like that. I would have loved to have both sisters as figures but I guess I'll settle for Sister Semilla & Momo. One thing I will say though is that Limited Run Games will surely take their sweet time before we even see the collector edition.
